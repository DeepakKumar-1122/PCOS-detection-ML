# PCOS Detection using Ultrasound Images
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the detection of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using ultrasound images. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder in women of reproductive age, often associated with various health complications.

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training and evaluation is available on Kaggle: [PCOS Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anaghachoudhari/pcos-detection-using-ultrasound-images)
- Additionally, real-time ultrasound images collected from a hospital are included in the RH_dataset directory.

## Project Overview

- **Notebook** : The Jupyter notebook file (PCOS_Detection.ipynb) contains the complete code for data loading, preprocessing, model development, training, evaluation, and testing.
- **Models** : Two convolutional neural network (CNN) models are implemented for PCOS detection, along with their training and evaluation.
- **Plots** : The notebook includes plots showing model loss and accuracy during training and validation phases.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/DeepakKumar-1122/PCOS-detection-ML

2. Open and run the Jupyter notebook PCOS_Detection.ipynb to train the models, visualize results, and test the model performance.

## Results:

- Model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix are provided in the notebook.
- Evaluation on the test dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the trained models in PCOS detection.
